### TDD House Automation

This is a House Automation project developed using TDD. It's based on James W. Grenning's Test-Driven Development for Embedded C example.

The only difference is that this test uses ceedling instead of plain unity framework.
Firstly install ceedling and the run `ceedling test:all` to run all the tests.
Ceedling has plenty of documentation around, so be happy! :)
